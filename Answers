Constructor Chaining:
The this() constructor call can be used to invoke the current class constructor (constructor chaining). 
This approach is better if you have many constructors in the class and want to reuse that constructor.
The this() constructor call should be used to reuse the constructor in the constructor.
It maintains the chain between the constructors i.e. it is used for constructor chaining.

Note: this basically returns the current class object

Rule: Call to this() must be the first statement in constructor.

class Student13{  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    Student13(){System.out.println("default constructor is invoked");}  
      
    Student13(int id,String name){  
    this ();//it is used to invoked current class constructor.  And it also must be the first statement inside the consrtctr
    this.id = id;  
    this.name = name;  
    }  
    void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}  
      
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    Student13 e1 = new Student13(111,"karan");  
    Student13 e2 = new Student13(222,"Aryan");  
    e1.display();  
    e2.display();  
   }  
}  
Output:
       default constructor is invoked
       default constructor is invoked
       111 Karan
       222 Aryan
