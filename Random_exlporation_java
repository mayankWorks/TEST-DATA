Hi Sir,

As you are aware my France VISA is going to expire in next few days i.e on 23rd October 2016
but i haven't got any communication till now about the project in FRANCE.
I am worried as the visa expiry date is very near now.

I have already shared the my profile/resume with you with key skills as JAVA and related 

technologies and also now i am trained in NICE Actimize AIS(Analytics Intelligence Server)
and RCM(Risk Case Management) modules.

PFA my profile along this mail.

Hoping for a positive response.

Regards,
